# AI-Powered Futuristic Business Dashboard 🚀


## 📌 Project Overview
We built a **futuristic business dashboard** that connects directly to **Google Sheets** for real-time analytics and KPIs.  
The system automatically updates client revenue and data using an **AI Agent powered by OpenAI**.  

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/ae567c16-fe6b-4f22-b496-db438c5acedf

We also integrated **Telegram bots** and **email notifications** for automated client communication and payment confirmations.  
Using **n8n workflows**, data flows seamlessly between Sheets, the dashboard, Telegram, and email – creating a high-tech, automated business assistant.
